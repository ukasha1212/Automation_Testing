Its too riskv to post normal sianals on a dav like this due to swings and movement too last. So if theres an
oppurtunity ill post entry as manual entry format
However those planning to trade it. Buying from support levels is what ill be doing if given the
oppurtunity.
NEw push
once ow
we will wait for it to exhaust before jumping in. If it starts with a push up
from the start then only way we calch it is with an entry before nano
An entry before hand can be risk incase it drops but setting TPs for 30pips will allow the noise of the
market to still bank the 1P before any dron

FOMC SETUP
FOMC PLAN
Okay everyone,
Like I always say its not always about trading if the market is not right. Newbies should not trade FOMC,
as too risky if you have not learnt how to manage ranges, which you will see us do as you spend more time
in our channel.
We did not post any normal straight forward signals todav due to FOMC and Triple witching friday. This is
good patience and as profesional traders its always good to learn to know when to stay out.
Those who can manage risk and want to look for opurtunity for a trade please remember we only take a
position if we see the right oportunity
The momentum with these events are too fast to post as a normal signal so I will prepare you from now for
ellies
PLAN OF ACTION FOR BUY SETUP
Overall we remain Bullish and therefore even if price drops due to news it will find its way up again.
Therefore, we need to keep this in mind and wait for a better entry should the price drop. If you dont want
to wait for the drop and want to take a position before FOMC then take a small enough position to be
able
to manage swings of 150 to 200 pips for layers from below.
Right now price is sitting between intraaday levels 1812 and 1805. Theres no ema5 cross
and lock dad bu
there is a candle boov close gap below 1805 leaving
a gap to 1800. But candle body close gaps are not as
strong as EMA5 cross and lock
Good entry areas for buys will be at 1796 but better entries will be at 1792 and 1787 anything lower for
entries are even better. Remember take 30 to 40 pips max in and out if your trading momentum whch is
riSky So dont try and ride all the way
Also remember let the first 10 minutes of the candle settle as thats mostly noise. When noise settles its
sligntly more controlled to take entries

FOMC SETUP
FOMC PLAN
•okay everyone,
Like I always say its not always about trading if the market is not right. Newbies should not trade FOMC, as
too risky if you have not learnt how to manage ranges, which you will see us do as you spend more time in
our channel
We did not post any normal straight forward signals today due to FOMC. This is good patience and as
profesional traders its always good to learn to know when to stay out.
Tho
se wno can mic
nage risk and want to look for opurtunity for a trade please remember we only take a
position if we see the right
oportunity.
The momentum with these events are4oo fast to post as a normal signal so I will prepare you from now for
entries.
PLAN OF ACTION FOR BUY SETUP
Overall we remain Bullish with the long term trend and therefore even if price drops due to news it will find
its way up again. Therefore, we need to keep this in mind and wait for a better
entry should the price drop.
If you dont want to wait for the drop and want to take a position before FOMC then take a small enough
position to be able to manage swings of 150 to 200 pips for layers from below.
Right now price is sitting at 1945. Theres no ema5 cross and lock gap but there is a previous trail gap to
195.
Remember take 30 to 40 pips max in and out if your trading momentum which is risky so dont try and ride
al the way
Also remember let the first 10 minutes of the candle settle as thats mostiy noise. When noise settles its
sligntly more controlled to take entries.

FOMC SETUP
FOMC PLAN
okay everyone,
like lahwavs sav its not alwavs about trading if the market is not right. Newbies should not trade FOMC
as too riskv if you have not learnt how to manage ranges, which you will see us do as you spend more time
Those who can manage risk and want to look for opurtunity for a trade please remember we only take a
position in we
see the rant oportunicy.
The momentum with these events are too fast to post as a normal signal so I will prepare you from now for

PLAN OF ACTION FOR BUY SETUP
I
Overall we remain Bullish with the long term trend and therefore even if price drops due to news it will find
its way up again. Therefore, we need to keep this in mind and wait for a better entry should the price drop.
If you dont want to wait for the drop and want to take a position before FOMC then take a small enough
position now to be able to manage swings of 150 to 200 pips for layers from below.
Right now price is sitting at 2028. Theres no ema5 cross and lock gap but 2031 is next
round of 30 pips
Remember take 30 to 40 pips max in and out if your trading momentum which is risky so dont try and ride
all the way.
Also remember let the first 10 minutes of the candle settle as thats mostly noise. When noise settles its
slightly more controlled to take entries.
Newbies can plav on demo
